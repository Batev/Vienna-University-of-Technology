# Vienna-University-of-Technology

## Overview

⋅⋅⋅In this repository I have uploaded some of the projects, that I have completed during my studies at the Vienna University of Technology.**

⋅⋅⋅Most of the courses are held in german, which makes the exercises to be written in german. The documentation is written in english._
