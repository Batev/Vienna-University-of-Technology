## k-Minimum Spanning Tree
The [k-Minimum Spanning Tree problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-minimum_spanning_tree) is NP-Hard.<br \>
The problem itself is for finding a minimum spanning tree with k nodes in a weighted graph.<br \>
The algorithm is implemented with a [Prim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm) [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)) and a [branch and bound algorithm design paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound).<br \><br \>
_The assignment is part of the [Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen 2](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?windowId=9e6&courseNr=186815&semester=2016S) course at the Vienna University of Technology.
