## Client Authentication
**An application for a client-server communication.**
The server registers/loads clients to/from a given database.
The [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) is synchronised with [semaphores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)) and happens with a [shared memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory).
A simple interface is introduced to the client, so that different actions can take place.
